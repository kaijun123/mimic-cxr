There is greater opacity in the right lower hemithorax than the left. This could be consolidation, but it could also be explained by atelectasis and a posteriorly collected pleural effusion. Heart is moderately enlarged, mediastinum is widened in part due to fat deposition, but an azygos fissure displays the azygos vein which is distended indicating elevated central venous pressure or volume, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. If there is any left pleural effusion, it is small. Cardiomegaly is moderate, but exaggerated by what may well be non-erect positioning. No pneumothorax."

No well-defined pneumothorax is identified, though subtle pneumothorax might not be apparent on this exam. On today's exam, a thin linear lucency projects over the cardiac silhouette, of uncertain etiology or significance. There has been some interval clearing of the left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with partial visualization of the left hemidiaphragm on today's exam. Vascular engorgement left upper zone is again noted, similar to the prior study. Possibility of a small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Subcutaneous emphysema along the lower left chest wall again noted. The right lung is unchanged, with atelectasis in the infrahilar region. No chf or right pleural effusion identified. Note is made that the right cardiac border is well defined. Small calcified granuloma in the right upper lung is again noted."

The mediastinum appear widened, which may be due to supine, ap portable technique, although if there is clinical concern for acute aortic injury, chest cta would be recommended."

However, the interstitium is diffusely more prominent which suggests that there could be superimposed interstitial edema or an atypical infection. Clinical correlation is advised. No large effusions. More focal patchy peripheral opacity in the right upper lung, abutting the minor fissure is felt to reflect existing fibrotic and postinflammatory changes which are slightly accentuated on the current study due to slightly lower lung volumes rather than representing a developing infectious process.

There is persistent layering right effusion and layering left effusion with more focal persistent airspace consolidation in the left base with associated air bronchograms.

There has been interval development of more confluent opacities in the left mid lung adjacent to the infrahilar region as well as in the right upper lobe. In addition, the vasculature appears indistinct. Although these findings may all reflect pulmonary edema, superimposed pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pneumothorax.

There is extensive left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema and multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures, including left third through seventh ribs, and possibly eighth rib. The left diaphragm is obscured which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, pleural effusion, pulmonary contusion. The right lung is not well assessed, but is lower in volume than that on the left. Relative opacity projecting over the partially imaged right lung could be due to layering pleural effusion, aspiration, and/or pulmonary contusion. Dual lead left-sided pacer device has leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle."

The trachea deviates mildly towards the left supporting such diagnosis.

A right internal jugular approach wire is seen terminating in a location, indicating the right ventricle. It is assumed that this is a temporary pacing wire. Electrode wire is overlying the left-sided lower neck region and terminates overlying the mediastinal structures. It is probably external.
