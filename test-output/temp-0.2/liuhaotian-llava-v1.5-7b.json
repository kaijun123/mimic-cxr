    "prediction": "The chest X-ray image depicts a person with a prominent right lung, which is larger than the left lung. The right lung is filled with air, while the left lung appears to be empty.

Other possible conditions that could cause this include a collapsed lung, a pneumonia, or a tension pneumothorax. However, without further information or a follow-up image, it is not possible to definitively diagnose the condition. It is essential to consult a medical professional for a proper evaluation and treatment plan."
